Hi, I'm Camron. People call me Cam. My email is CamronHaider@gmail.com and my github is Github.com/camronh and my LinkedIn is https://www.linkedin.com/in/camronhaider . I am 29 years old and live in Broward, Florida. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and have been working with computers since I can remember. I enjoy the learning and building full stack projects, but I lean more towards back end development. I live in Broward, Florida. I have a webcam and microphone setup and I am ready for a video interview if you would like to do one! I am friendly and positive and love working with a team. I get along well with people and am a real workaholic. I have been working remote my whole career. 

I have been doing software development for 5 years. My first foray into coding was when I started my VPN business, Brazy Proxies. The market for Brazy Proxies was for sneaker bot users. See, there was a lot of money in using a bot to purchase rare sneakers and sell them at a mark up. The more proxies the bot had access to, the higher the user's chances of successfully ordering the shoes. I was never very good at using the bots so all of my money ended up going into proxy expenses. I figured, “Hey, I may as well learn to make these”. First I learned how to lease and host IP address subnets. Then I hired a Python developer in Singapore from Freelancer.com to build me a script that would allocate username:password authentication to IP addresses that I was hosting. He build the MVP, which was a python script that took CLI arguments do to the allocations and a SQL Database to store the data about allocations. After he built that, he disappeared on me and I was left to my own devices. I build an API that would send bash python commands to do the allocations automatically. I built dashboards for users and a dashboard for the backend Admin management. I ended up doing $750,000 in revenue in one year and accumulating 20,000 Twitter followers with no money spent on marketing. I used NodeJS for the back end. The API's were built using Express.JS. The front ends where built in Vue.js and Wordpress.

After finding success with the VPN business, I decided to try my hand at building a sneaker bot. I was super enamored with the AWS cloud at the time and wanted to make my bot the first bot to be fully cloud based. I made it all the way to beta and actually had a very successful beta period, but couldn't manage to make the costs work with what the market was expecting at the time. But in the process I learned a ton. The actual bot was built using headless browser automation via Playwright in NodeJS with a DynamoDB for storing task data. These tasks would usually run for about 15-25 minutes so I figured I could host the worker functions in AWS Lambda. The functionality worked great but Lambdas can't run Firefox, they can only run chromium. Chromium gets flagged very quickly by anti-bot software so that wasn't an option, I needed to use Firefox. So I dockerized the worker function and put it on ECS (after trying Firefox in a docker on Lambda with no success) using Fargate. That worked out almost perfectly! The worker functions successfully checked out product! The only downsides were the cold-starts taking forever and the costs. With cold-starts being so slow, if something went wrong, you could miss the product release entirely. After wracking my brain trying to get Firefox to work on a Lambda, I eventually gave up and outsourced the task. I offered a decent prize for anyone that can get Firefox working on Lambda. A lot of developers tried but nobody was able to do it, so I moved on.

That's when I found API3, the company I am at now. API3 is a DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Its a fancy crypto way of saying that the company is ran by its shareholder, or in this case, token holders. API3 is a blockchain technology company, so not just a crypto token or anything like that. We offer what is called an oracle service, which basically connects APIs to blockchains. The offering consists of our product, Airnode, which consists of 5 serverless functions that we help API providers deploy. Those functions just poll the blockchain for new requests to your API address, turn new requests into normal REST request, make those requests to your API, and return those responses on the blockchain. My role as Integration Manager was, on one hand, to integrate client's APIs with our API specs (very similar to Swagger), meet with enterprise clients and walk them through deployment via Docker and Terraform. On the other hand, my role was to build Proofs-of-concept for Airnode. I would have to come up with uses cases for API's in smart contracts, design and designate tasks to my 2 employees, document, and demo these PoC's. When I am working with the core development team, we use Typescript, Terraform, Docker, Lambda and NPX. When I am building full stack PoC's we have to use vanilla NodeJS so that the code is more readable for the clients. I am leaving because I want to get out of the blockchain space.
